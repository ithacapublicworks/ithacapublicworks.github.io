If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed.

<h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Where the Media Death Spiral Brought Us: The Decline of Local Reporting, and an Industry Looking for its Footing"</span></h3>

The newspaper industry in the U.S. has been undergoing a significant decline since the early 2000s. The rise of the internet ushered in an era of information abundance and accessibility. However, this transition has severely impacted the traditional business models that once supported local newspapers, resulting in noticeable gaps in community coverage across the country. All of this is set against a climate where trust in media is approaching historic lows in the U.S.<br><br>This presentation will illustrate these challenges, both on a local scale and within a broader context. Additionally, we will delve into the new models that are being explored in an effort to revitalize local reporting.

<h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"For Whom the Dinner Bell Tolls: The Struggles of America’s Farming Community and How NY FarmNet Helps"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Adam Howell</span>
<br>Outreach Director, FarmNet Cornell
<br>
<br>

Everyone is aware of the price of food – from kitchen tables to restaurant counters, food costs impact our lives in profound ways. But another, less understood cost associated with our food is born out of the pressures faced by farmers as they struggle to succeed working in one of the most unforgiving industries in America. Farmers deal with numerous stressors outside of their control including market pressures, weather, price increases, supplies, and many more. Furthermore, farmers deal with the geographic challenge of being isolated from support services in rural areas, and cultural/psychological challenges stemming from personal stigmas against seeking help.<br><br>In this Public Works talk, learn about a unique program in NYS that provides free, confidential support for farmers to help with any number of issues they may face. NY FarmNet approaches farm assistance and support through a “holistic” model by deploying a consultant team representing both the personal and financial aspects of every challenge.
