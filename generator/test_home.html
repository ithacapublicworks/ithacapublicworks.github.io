If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>April 3rd</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>an astrophysics</i> talk:


<h3 id='lkeller'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Are You an Umbraphile? Understanding and Observing the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Luke Keller</span>
<br>Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Ithaca College
<br>
<br>

 Are you planning a trip to the path of totality on April 8, 2024? You may be an umbraphile! Not sure what an umbraphile or a path of totality is? Join us as we explore the social and physical science of eclipses. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between Earth and the Sun casting its shadow on Earth’s surface. Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, but the shadow rarely passes over populated areas and most often passes over the oceans. The eclipse of April 2024 will be a rare treat because the moon will photo bomb the sun for tens of millions of people including communities right here in Central New York. We'll cover the details of how, when, and why eclipses happen and how to safely observe them.




<br><br>and <i>a political history</i> talk:


<h3 id='cfigueroa'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Do you know a forgotten Gay Quaker, Labor, and Civil Rights Leader?  Meet Bayard Taylor Rustin!"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Carlos Figueroa</span>
<br>Associate Professor of Politics at Ithaca College
<br>
<br>

 Bayard T. Rustin was a political activist, writer, and organizer committed to social, political, and economic justice and equality across different cultures, countries, and ideological perspectives.  His beliefs and actions often led to controversial positions.  Although Rustin is most well-known for organizing the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, he accomplished much more than that.  Sorry, Netflix!  This talk delves into how and why Rustin’s pragmatic Quaker faith influenced his politics and helped him navigate the various controversies of his time throughout an extraordinary life from the 1940s through the 1980s.
