If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>November 1st</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>a ghostwriting</i> talk:


<h3 id='madisonfitzpatrick'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Ghostwriting: An Insider's View of an Invisible Profession"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Madison Fitzpatrick</span>
<br>Writer and Brand Manager
<br>
<br>

 Ghostwriting often gets a bad rap as a cop-out for politicians and celebrities who are too lazy to write their own books. But the truth is, ghostwriting is more common than ever, and for many authors, it's no longer the shameful secret it once was. So, who actually hires ghostwriters? What do ghostwriters really do? And what's the future of this ancient profession in a world of generative AI? 



<br><br>and <i>a psychology</i> talk:


<h3 id='andresmontealegre'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Can You Accurately Perceive How Others Think About You?"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Andr√©s Montealegre</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in the Cornell Psychology Dept.
<br>
<br>

 Ever wonder how others perceive you based on your actions? We all do. Shockingly, recent studies in psychology reveal we're often quite mistaken about these perceptions. For example, people think they're less liked by others than they actually are, or they assume others aren't interested in their unsolicited advice when in fact they are. Such findings could help us get along better with others. But how accurate are these studies? And is it possible that participants in these studies are just trying to appear 'nice' when answering research questions? In this talk, I'll share my own research on this topic and discuss if we should take these findings at face value. Join me to discuss the fascinating, messy world of how we're seen by others.
