If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>March 6th</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>an entomology</i> talk:


<h3 id='jbrown'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Getting A Buzz On: Mojitos and Mosquitoes"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Joel Brown</span>
<br>Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Entomology at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Do you think you get bitten more than your friends? Do you wish we could make all mosquitoes go away? Want to know why your symptoms might get you thrown in a bush? In this talk I'll cover the weird biology and wacky tropes about everyone's favourite insect: mosquitoes. Come and find out how to keep yourself healthy and less itchy this summer.



<br><br>and <i>a music</i> talk:


<h3 id='ebeltran'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Latinidad Sinofonica: Asian Diasporic Visibilities in Salsa and Reggaetón"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Elias Beltrán</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Salsa music and reggaetón, though most clearly articulated in the Hispanophone Caribbean, are related by diasporic connections coming from “histories of migrations and cultural exchange throughout all of the Americas.” And, though some scholars suggest that reggaetón should be read through its social and political “positioning to cultural expressions exclusively centered on blackness,” I respectfully disagree. While holding—and celebrating(!)—the African Diaspora as a creative nexus in both genres, exclusively positioning the cultural expressions of either salsa or reggaetón on blackness keeps us from connecting “asymmetrical histories and processes” that have, all too often, been examined separately, rather than approached as responses to shared conditions with deep implications. Looking at the musical presences and relations between African and Asian Diasporic subjects in salsa and reggateón refuses not only the idea of separate histories, but also exposes how racialized
mimicry fuels antagonisms, and reinforces colonial subjects as negatively known and dispositively knowable. In this way, looking at the presence and contributions of the Chinese Diaspora in the musics of the Hispanophone Caribbean, previously a site of occlusion, emerges not as a pitting against but as a potential source of coalition-building precisely because of the intimacy of shared histories.
