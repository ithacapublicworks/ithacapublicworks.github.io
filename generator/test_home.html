If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>February 5th</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>a medieval studies</i> talk:


<h3 id='jlawrence'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Down Bad in Medieval Baghdad, or a Tale as Old as Time"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Jonny Robert Lawrence</span>
<br>Assistant Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell
<br>
<br>

In the early 10th century, a man called Ibn Dāwūd died from love – or, that’s what the biographers tell us, at least. Ibn Dāwūd lived and died in Baghdad, at the time one of the world’s major centres of art, culture, science, and mathematics. He was a strict jurist and legal thinker, but also a flâneur, an aesthete and a poet-author. Upon meeting a beautiful local apothecary, Muḥammad ibn Jāmiʿ (or, was it Wahb ibn Jāmiʿ? The sources aren’t sure…), he falls madly in love and the pair embark upon a sweet, seemingly reciprocal relationship. Yet, love’s course is not as easy as it may seem and all sorts of personal, social and legal problems might get in the way… with fatal consequences. In this talk, we will be meeting our medieval forebears where they are at, and exploring how their tales of overwhelming passion, death and destruction can speak to us in the contemporary world.



<br><br>and <i> a public health</i> talk:


<h3 id='szuber'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Rethinking Sex: What We Know About the Sexual Response Cycle and How It Can Improve Your Bedroom Tonight"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Stephanie Zuber</span>
<br>A Local Sex Therapist (LMHC, MS)
<br>
<br>

Ever wondered why your body doesn’t always respond the way you expect in the bedroom? The answer lies in the science of the sexual response cycle. Join us for a brief dive into what we now know about sexual arousal, desire, and satisfaction—and how you can use this knowledge to improve your sex life tonight. You’ll learn about the revolutionary "dual control model" of sexual arousal, a game-changing framework that radically shifts the way we think about horniness. Whether you're looking to reignite the spark, enhance intimacy, or simply better understand your own body, this talk will offer practical insights you can start using right away!
