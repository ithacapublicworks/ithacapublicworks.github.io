If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The origin story of Nollywood is intriguing, complex, and intertwined by multiple histories,
people, and geographies â€“ it unfolds like the most drama-packed film that you have yet to see.
In terms of output, Nollywood is the second-largest film industry in the world. It is surpassed by
Bollywood, with the United States-grown Hollywood taking the third slot. Nollywood has
inspired the emergence of several African film industries, it orchestrates a space for post-
colonial African migrants to engage with home-grown film productions, and lately, it has been
expanding its reach via distribution on global streaming sites such as as Netflix. This talk asks:
What is Nollywood, and how did it become a global film industry? How does the industry
continue to position itself, both within and outside of Africa? Drawing on its origin story and its
point of contact, I spotlight the exciting profile of this African film industry.
