1	October 5th	2022	Dr. Seth Koproski	Lecturer in Cornell's Dept. of Literatures in English	a literature	Did We Believe in Dragons?: Fantastic Animals and the Medieval North Atlantic	"Stories of phoenixes, werewolves, unicorns, and dragons fill our media, our libraries, and our minds-- yet, for some reason, we tend to think of medieval people as ""silly"" or ""superstitious"" for engaging with these same mythic animals. We understand that these creatures are not and were never ""real"", but they have served the needs of human writers and storytelling for millennia, including today. This talk is about taking these animals, and medieval belief in general, seriously, asking: Why do these beliefs exist and how were these beliefs practiced? In what books and in what places can we find fantastic animals? And what can the (non)existence of the dragon tell us about how medieval people constructed the world around them?"	sethkoproski
1	October 5th	2022	Dr. Zach Ulibarri	Postdoctoral Associate in the Cornell ASTRA Lab	a physics	A Song of Ice and Dust, or: Why We're Sending a 40 Million Dollar Flying Trash Can to Europa	If you wanted to search for aliens in our very own solar system, where would you look?<br>  What types of signals or measurements could convince you that life is actually there?  <br>  Why is the University of Colorado building a $40 million flying trash can and sending it to Europa?  <br>  How can a flying trash can find signs of habitability or even potentially alien life?  <br>  What in the world does any of that have to do with dust?  <br>Find out at the inaugural Public Works!	zachulibarri
2	November 2nd	2022	Dr. Eve Snyder	Historian at The History Center in Tompkins County and Project Director of HistoryForge	a history	Who Lived Here? Using HistoryForge to Engage People in Local History in Ithaca, NY and Beyond	"Have you ever walked down a street and had something about an old building capture your eye? Perhaps an interesting architectural detail caused you to wonder when a house was built, who lived there, and what their lives were like? Ithaca\'s buildings and people of the past can serve as an important entry point into this community\'s history but what then? What does it take to encourage meaningful public engagement with history? Digital history projects have the potential to increase public engagement with the subject matter, but how can they avoid the trap of presenting a curated version of history that limits additional inquiry.<br><br>This talk is about <a href = ""https://tompkins.historyforge.net/"">HistoryForge</a>, an open-source digital history project from The History Center in Tompkins County that aims to engage the public in historical inquiry at all levels of the project\'s development: from helping to build the project\'s historical infrastructure by creating map layers and transcribing census records, to querying the resulting census data to learn more about the community and exploring the results on historic map layers."	evesnyder

Tolkien consistently treats these three as intrinsic virtues in a world full of suffering and loss. Explore the centrality of these themes to Tolkien, his world, and today.	jamesnagy
3	December 7th	2022	Dr. Ben Fried	Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Literatures in English at Cornell University	a humanities	The Inside Story: How Editors Shape Books, Institutions, and World Literature	This talk will take you to the crossroads of power and creativity. Editors are the invisible gatekeepers of literature, shaping texts and tastes out of public sight. What do they actually do, and how have their actions changed literary history? “The Inside Story” will investigate three remarkable writer-editor relationships and three examples of editorial labor determining the fate of a literary work: one creative, one destructive, and one poised uneasily between the two. We will look at the Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul getting his start on BBC Radio; the short-story superstar Mavis Gallant falling out with The New Yorker; Penguin India risking it all on Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy, one of the longest novels ever written, and dominating the subcontinent as a result. And so we will move through the twentieth century—from the Caribbean to North America to South Asia—uncovering the editorial networks linking literary institutions in London and New York to Anglophone authors around the world. Drawing the editor from backstage to center stage, “The Inside Story” will illuminate the influence of this crucial cultural figure, for good and bad, from heyday to present-day decline.	benfried
3	December 7th	2022	Dr. Ligia Coelho	Fulbright Scholar in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University	a science	Orange is the New Blue – A Guide to Finding Colorful Aliens	Biological pigments or “biopigments” are what make life colorful but also resilient to radiation, lack of available liquid water, and harsh temperatures – the typical weather forecast in space! Microbes that live in ice have a pretty hard time with these conditions too, and so, they tend to be very colorful – which makes them very good references for what life may look like in the cosmos! Future telescopes will be able to search for these colorful features, but first we need to translate them from biology into the language of space missions: spectroscopy!<br><br>What does the spectral fingerprint of a biopigment look like? How can that help us search for life in the cosmos? And more importantly…can we really have planets covered by orange aliens?!	ligiacoelho
4	February 1st	2023	Megan Barrington	PhD Candidate in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University	a science	Kometes: An Enduring Journey from Fiery Omens to Icy Worlds	Since bygone eras of antiquity, humans have watched in astonishment, intrigue, and terror as brilliant orbs of light amidst an illuminated drift entered the heavenly spheres. Could they be harbingers of doom? Weather phenomena? Balls of fire in the sky? Wild speculations and superstitions ever follow in their wakes—but what are comets really? And what can we learn from them? After hundreds of years of asking such questions, we finally have some answers, even as so much remains unknown. Join us on a journey of fire and ice to discover how these objects once believed to signal the end of an era could be responsible for the origins of life as we understand it today.	meganbarrington
4	February 1st	2023	Dr. Seth Strickland	Joseph F. Martino \'53 Lecturer in the Dept. of Literatures in English at Cornell University	a humanities	The Last Medieval Scribe: John Colyns and Authorial Control	“The Last Medieval Scribe: John Colyns and Authorial Control,” takes the twilight of medieval manuscript culture as its focus. For a few years until 1521, a bookseller named John Colyns carefully constructed a book that was very ordinary for his time but one of a dying breed. It contained, among other things, both century-old medieval poem and one that was written during his lifetime, both copied by hand -- the latter likely from a copy circulated among friends of the author. Colyns prophesied the fame of the new works in the book to his book-binding efforts – we’ll discover whether his claim is founded or whether other forces upended his plans. With	sethstrickland
5	March 1st	2023	Daniela Samur	PhD Candidate in the Cornell History Dept.	a history	Plenty Penmanship: The Politics of Paper in late Nineteenth-century Bogotá	In late nineteenth century Bogotá, the Biblioteca Nacional –Colombia’s legal deposit library– was labeling some of its prints as “useless” and selling them as scrap. The money from the sales, directors of the Biblioteca explained, would be put to better use in paying for bindings. Other books, deemed more important and worth saving, needed to be properly bound so that they could resist peoples’ fingers, time, and mice. The tension between preservation and destruction at the Biblioteca Nacional in Bogotá during the late nineteenth century was not an issue about hierarchies of knowledge, but one about the daily and mundane logistics of ordering. This is a story about how workers at Colombia’s central library dreamed of an organized and exhaustive collection of prints but couldn’t even manage to walk through the hallways without stumbling over piles of books. Gathering, inventorying, cataloguing, and putting books on shelves, I show in this presentation, was a material practice, and one shaped by the scarcity of paper and of people’s penmanship.	danielasamur
5	March 1st	2023	Dr. Luke Keller	Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Ithaca College	a physics	Primordial planets: When did they form and what were they like?	Student: When did planets first form?<br><br>Prof. Luke: Well, within a few million years of the sun's formation the planets formed in a disk of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk.<br><br>Student: I know that. My question is when did the FIRST planets form? Was it right after the Big Bang?<br><br>Prof. Luke: Well...hmmm...I don't know, let's Google it.<br><br><br>Turns out no one knows in much detail. And so began my current research project. We understand the process of planet formation in our own galaxy with increasing detail and observational evidence, but how can we extend that understanding to planet formation in the early universe? Presumably the first planets formed around the first stars. In principle we can observe the first stars by observing the first galaxies, but they are so far away that the galaxies appear as dim red fuzzballs even using the James Webb Space Telescope. Resolving individual stars within those galaxies is not currently possible. We will explore this conundrum and a possible solution. Then we'll reward ourselves with some wild speculation about aliens.	lukekeller
6	April 5th	2023	Dr. Hunter Adams	Lecturer in the Cornell Electrical Engineering Dept.	a science	Spacecraft Small and Mighty: Exploring Space and Studying Cows with Chip-Scale Spacecraft	This talk introduces an entirely new kind of spacecraft that draws from concepts in ecology. This spacecraft (the Monarch) weighs as much as a penny and is the first to trade quantity, rather than cost, for low mission risk. By taking advantage of recent technological advancements in unrelated disciplines and taking a statistical approach to mission assurance, Monarchs open the door to an entirely new paradigm in space access and exploration. This talk describes the challenges and advantages unique to tiny spacecraft. It also presents a number of use cases, involving distributed sensing and planetary science, that are unique to spacecraft of the Monarch’s diminutive size and large quantity. Results from simulated lunar impact survival tests and a case-study planetary science mission (conducted with cows) are presented and discussed, suggesting one particular use case, along with the results from launch tests conducted in collaboration with SpinLaunch.	hunteradams
6	April 5th	2023	Michael Caporizzo	Associate Professor of Music Performance at Ithaca College	a music	Edison to Atmos: The Evolution of Audio Systems and the Musical Listening Experience	For over a century, audio technology has been an integral component to experiencing and sharing music. Recording has evolved from a novelty which captured a vague facsimile of a performance to a technically superior mode of expression which in most cases supplants live performance. Throughout this evolution, there have been several instances where a technological advancement changed the recording and consumption processes permanently; mass duplication, electrical recording, magnetic tape, stereo capture and disc-cutting, multitrack recording, and digital recording are just a few of the most consequential advancements. In 2023, we are currently experiencing another transformative advancement – immersive audio. A once esoteric format has quickly become accessible to consumers through streaming platforms, and the recording industry is racing to catch up. This presentation will highlight a few of these key transformative events as well as some of the music indicative of these advancements. Emphasis will be placed on immersive audio technology, and musical examples will be played back over a (modest) immersive sound system. Perhaps history offers some clues to understand where we might be heading next.	michaelcaporizzo
7	May 3rd	2023	Molly Ryan	Director of Cornell Cinema	a film	Movie Magic/Sounding Dissent	In this two-part presentation, Molly Ryan, the new director of Cornell Cinema, will outline her programming vision for Cornell Cinema and argue why it still matters to see films in movie theater. She will then discuss her research on sound and violence in the work of British television director Alan Clarke (and why it might not make sense to show these films at Cornell Cinema despite how much she loves them). Her presentation will explore Clarke’s engagement with sound, domestic space, and the media landscape of Thatcherite Britain in three films produced for the BBC (ROAD, CHRISTINE, and STARS OF THE ROLLER STATE DISCO), focusing on how Clarke effectively weaponized the genre of the television play in the 1980s, using it to In this two-part presentation, Molly Ryan, the new director of Cornell Cinema, will outline her programming vision for Cornell Cinema and argue why it still matters to see films in movie theater.

7	May 3rd	2023	Karl Smolenski	US-Compact Muon Solenoid High-Luminosity LHC Systems Engineer, Cornell Univeristy	a science	What the Hell is a Higgs's Boson? An Insider's Look at the Physics of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN	Peter Higgs in 1963-64 proposed a mechanism and related particle that could explain how some other elementary particles acquired mass.  This theory led to a multi decade search for the eponymous Higgs boson and the construction of incredibly complex accelerators and detectors to generate and observe these proposed particles.  Finally in a data set from the period 2011-2013 the particle was observed experimentally, and this filled in the last bit of the standard model of particle physics.  Higgs and colleagues were awarded the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. <br><br> I’ll try to give some background on the accelerator and detectors at CERN that were used in this groundbreaking work.  Our current work is leading to a second-generation detector capable of detecting immense quantities of Higgs with great precision to fully understand its properties.  As an engineer I’ll give some practical examples of the problems that need to be solved to enable this science.	karlsmolenski
8	June 7th	2023	Dr. Daisy Rosas Vargas	Associate Professor of Chemistry at Ithaca College	a chemistry	Behind the Taste: The Chemistry of Whiskey	We pick up a cold glass to drink, beads of water running down the side. The brown intoxicating liquid tastes bitter and smells earthy, with a touch of sweetness. These descriptions sound like it MUST belong to precious morning iced coffee.  Not quite. This is whiskey. We can use the same visual, olfactory, and touch senses used to enjoy coffee to learn about chemistry that makes whiskey. This talk will focus on American-made whiskey and cocktails with a smokey touch of international facts.	daisyrosas
8	June 7th	2023	Dr. Alison Ritterhaus	Lynch Family Postdoctoral Associate in Curricular Engagement at the Johnson Museum	an archaeology	Replica, Repair, Forgery: Archaeological Sites as Art Forms'	“Step into the past!” Public communications related to archaeological sites often promise an immersive experience that allows visitors to enter a specific historic moment in a particular place, a kind of time travel. But how realistic is this premise? In this talk, I will begin with a case study of a Roman villa buried by the 79 CE eruption of Mount Vesuvius on the Bay of Naples, discussing its history of excavation, reconstruction, presentation to the public, and diffusion through contemporary media around the question of where, and whether, the “real” villa exists. The relevance of this question hinges on public perception: how do archaeologists communicate their findings and knowledge, as well as the gaps, with those who visit? I will close with a brief comparison to an American “archaeological” park and the ways that public-facing historical sites affect the way that people relate emotionally to the past.	alisonritterhaus
9	July 5th	2023	Dr. Zach Ulibarri	Postdoctoral Associate in the Cornell ASTRA Lab	a politics	On the Choice of a Rocket: How congressional politics can make you spend hundreds of millions of dollars planning for the wrong mission but then still get mad at you for going over budget	"In 2024 the Europa Clipper will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket to begin its five and half year trip to Jupiter, where it will study the icy ocean world of Europa (which is one of the best bets for alien life in our own solar system!). But for quite some time, NASA mission planners had to allow for the possibility of launching on both the Falcon Heavy and the United Launch Alliance Space Launch System (SLS). Why? Because the SLS had friends in congress, of course. In this talk, we'll learn about how congressional politics can make life hell for mission planning, why NASA missions are so expensive, what single points of failure are, and why the indecision of launch vehicles can burn unbelievable sums of money. We'll also look at the Galileo spacecraft as a cautionary tale about changing mission parameters late in the game.<br><br><div class=""box"">  <img src=""images/ulibarri.png"" style = 'width: 550' class='center'> </div>"	zachulibarri2

In this talk, Dr. Hawkins will introduce the audience to the nuanced challenge of simultaneously tackling climate change while expanding access to energy infrastructure in under-developed regions of the world. Topics will include limitations of intermittent electricity suppliers, options for baseload power generators, and the potential of geothermal energy to transform global energy infrastructure, including the Earth Source Heat project at Cornell University.<br><br><div class=""box"">  <img src=""images/hawkinsbanner.jpg"" class='center'> </div>"	adamhawkins
10	August 2nd	2023	Jay Leeming	Performance Storyteller	a mythology	How to tell Epic Stories and Save the Planet at the Same Time	Before the industrial revolution every healthy community on the planet included numerous storytellers, individuals trained in poetry, music and the dream-logic of mythology who would regularly dazzle their listeners with mind-opening tales of love, death and other worlds. Over the last century we have surrendered this power to multinational corporations, and the consequences have not been good. Performance storyteller Jay Leeming has spent years telling stories in theaters, schools, and National Parks, and in this talk he will not only illuminate his own process of learning to tell both the Odyssey and the Mahabharata epic of India but will also offer guidance in how we can turn off Netflix, awaken the visionary mythteller within each of us, and save the planet through story.	jayleeming
10	August 2nd	2023	Dr. Daniel Sprockett	Postdoctoral Associate in the Cornell Dept. of Ecology and Evolution	a microbiology	Awash in Wee Beasties: How microbial diversity shapes the animal world (and your own behavior)	The gut microbiome, or the complex community of microbes that colonize the intestinal tract, can have a wide range of effects on their host’s physiology, metabolism, and behavior. In humans, much has been discovered about how these microbes impact a person’s health and wellbeing, but much less is known about how they influence the fitness of other animals. In this talk, Dr. Sprockett will explore the ways that the gut microbiome impacts their animals hosts ranging from rodents to birds and even primates, with a focus on how we know what we know. Topics will span from short-term responses to long-term evolutionary consequences, and even how microbes might be affecting everyday decisions. The presentation will conclude with a (hopeful!) look at the future of microbiome-based interventions.	danielsprocket
11	September 6th	2023	Dr. Heather Huson and Dr. Srikanth Krishnamoorthy	Cornell Dept. of Animal Science	a dog genomics	The Story of Balto, an Elite Sled Dog: Through his Genome	"Almost 100 years ago, Balto, along with a pack of elite sled dogs helped save the community of Nome, Alaska, from a diphtheria outbreak. Balto is representative of the sled dogs of the era who were reputed for their hardiness, endurance, and tolerance of harsh conditions at a time when northern communities relied on them for transportation, protection, and companionship. Unlike modern breeds, Balto and his contemporaries were products of generations of mating of diverse, outbred dogs selected for their performance and hardiness.  Today, Balto is immortalized with a statue in Central Park and is physically preserved and on display at the Cleaveland Museum of Natural History. We asked ourselves, could we use advances in genomic technologies and ancient DNA recovery techniques to parse through Balto’s DNA and understand selection emphasis and diversity occurring in sled dogs in the 1930’s? Could we decipher Balto’s physical appearance from his DNA and identify healthy developmental gene variants that may have endowed sled dogs in that era with abilities to withstand and thrive in harsh environments? Could we use our findings to guide modern breeders to breed healthier dogs? <br><br>Also, here's a photo of Dr. Huson racing as a musher in Alaska!<div class=""box""> <img src=""images/huson_sled.jpg"" class='center'> </div>"	heatherhuson

Maybe you caught the fever back in 2018, watching the Men’s curling team win USA’s first gold medal in the sport, saw it in a movie, or have visited Canada at any point in your life.  Alita started curling with the Finger Lakes Curling Club in 2018 after taking one of the first Learn to Curl’s, soon after the club’s founding.  She currently skips, is an instructor, volunteers on the club’s board, and travels to friendlies and bonspiels to compete and meet other curlers.  In a Public Works’ version of broomstacking, Alita will talk about the history, explain the types and rules of curling, and delve a little into the science, all while taking part in a major part of curling: drinking beverages. 	alitahoward

16	March 6th	2024	Elias Beltrán	PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at Cornell University	a music	Latinidad Sinofonica: Asian Diasporic Visibilities in Salsa and Reggaetón	Salsa music and reggaetón, though most clearly articulated in the Hispanophone Caribbean, are related by diasporic connections coming from “histories of migrations and cultural exchange throughout all of the Americas.” And, though some scholars suggest that reggaetón should be read through its social and political “positioning to cultural expressions exclusively centered on blackness,” I respectfully disagree. While holding—and celebrating(!)—the African Diaspora as a creative nexus in both genres, exclusively positioning the cultural expressions of either salsa or reggaetón on blackness keeps us from connecting “asymmetrical histories and processes” that have, all too often, been examined separately, rather than approached as responses to shared conditions with deep implications. Looking at the musical presences and relations between African and Asian Diasporic subjects in salsa and reggateón refuses not only the idea of separate histories, but also exposes how racialized mimicry fuels antagonisms, and reinforces colonial subjects as negatively known and dispositively knowable. In this way, looking at the presence and contributions of the Chinese Diaspora in the musics of the Hispanophone Caribbean, previously a site of occlusion, emerges not as a pitting against but as a potential source of coalition-building precisely because of the intimacy of shared histories.	ebeltran

18	May 1st	2024	Dr. Kim Haines-Eitzen	Hendrix Memorial Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and Religious Studies Program at Cornell University	a religious history	A Field Guide to the Apocalypse	The language of apocalypse is seemingly all around us. From the devastation of war to the aftermath of voracious wildfires, from doomsday preppers to ecological collapse we confront the persistent vitality of apocalyptic language and thought.  In this talk, I will take us back to the roots of apocalyptic thought in antiquity to reflect on the sense of revelation—an uncovering or an unveiling—in the apocalyptic imagination. But I also want to unpack something more elemental—namely, how earth, wind, water, and especially fire animated apocalypticism in the past and what they might teach us about our present moment.	khaines-eitzen

Wait, Why Should I Care?': The Societal Benefits of Fundamental Science	 Particle and accelerator physics might sound like science fiction to you, but they affect us in the real world more than you might think (in a good way!). Let’s dive into these fields of research and see what they are, where they come from, and how they have changed our everyday lives. We’ll start with a brief overview and history before getting into some applications. 	achapelain
19	June 5th	2024	Dr. Sriramya Nair	Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University	an environmental engineering	Sustainability and Automation: The Future of Concrete Industry	The construction industry is currently facing many challenges with respect to shortage of skilled workers, greenhouse gas emissions, and our need for massive quantities of construction materials. In this talk I will first focus on this global materials challenge and lay out pathways for achieving sustainability in the cement and concrete industry. These include examples such as the use of mineral waste materials, low- grade calcined clays, and carbonated steel slags. Next, I will focus on advances enabled through automation. Specifically, 3D printing with concrete or additive construction can be a path forward to efficiently use materials and reduce the amount of waste that is generated. Furthermore, robotic construction provides an opportunity to fabricate complex structures such as gyroids. A gyroid is a triply periodic minimal surface that efficiently distributes stress under compression loading in all orientations. Using a 2-component system with an in-house developed flowable mixture and with injection of accelerator at the nozzle, I will demonstrate our ability to print these complex geometries to create and test structural components such as walls.	snair
19	June 5th	2024	Stephanie M. López	PhD Candidate in Romance Studies and Mellon Graduate Fellow at Cornell University	an environmental humanities	Mangrove Mothers: Environmental Resilience at the Edges of the Colombian Nation	Mangroves form an essential barrier between oceans and land protecting shorelines from storm surges and rising tides while mothers are threshold subjects that create a buffer between the public and private spheres preserving them as separate. But what can mangroves and mothers teach us about environmental resilience at a time when countries are firmly reasserting the nuclear family as the center of care and economic consumption ? This talk delves into Dulce (2018) a short ten-minute documentary co-directed by Guille Isa and Angello Faccini that grapples with the delicate ecosystem of a Pacific mangrove forest and a community of clam harvesters on the Pacific coast department of Nariño in Colombia. These mangrove mothers show us how porous boundaries and a politics of place create havens for social and physical life to thrive. 	slopez

In terms of output, Nollywood is the second-largest film industry in the world. It is surpassed by Bollywood, with the United States-grown Hollywood taking the third slot. Nollywood has inspired the emergence of several African film industries, it orchestrates a space for post- colonial African migrants to engage with home-grown film productions, and lately, it has been expanding its reach via distribution on global streaming sites such as as Netflix. This talk asks: What is Nollywood, and how did it become a global film industry? How does the industry continue to position itself, both within and outside of Africa? Drawing on its origin story and its point of contact, I spotlight the exciting profile of this African film industry.	rabutsa

While there are many examples of sounds in media that fit easily into one of these categories or the other, some sounds may seem to cross or blur the boundaries between these categories in interesting ways. In this presentation, I highlight some sounds in video games that are both sound effects and musical/music. I consider a variety of sounds from select games, for example very early games like Pong (1972), and more recent games like Super Mario Galaxy (2007). How might such musical sound effects (or sound-effect music) impact a player’s/listener’s experience with a game? Video games provide a rich field in which to explore blurry categories of “sound effect” and “music,” and these questions of function and musicality are also relevant more widely in our media-filled world.	emedina-gray

We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.” All around the world, high school and college students are coming to understand the world’s most complex issues by becoming the delegates who debate them. Model United Nations (MUN) is a simulation of the UN, and it usually appeals to people interested in global politics, problem-solving with other like-minded delegates, public speaking, and debate. The TeenDay Ithaca MUN team will give an overview of the UN and what MUN is. We will explain how MUN allows students from all walks of life to explore new possible careers, and develop life skills such as public speaking, collaboration, and more. The end of the presentation will see a brief demo of what takes place in a MUN conference. Any and all points of inquiry will be addressed as long as decorum is maintained.	teen-day-mun

23	October 3rd	2024	Pete Miller	Local Expert	a social philosophy	Intersubjectivity / Constructing and Reconstructing Social Constructs	As human beings, we live in three kinds of reality. The single physical reality we all share full of rocks, trees, and beautiful gorges to walk through and appreciate them is objective. The internal mental reality we each have in our own mind made of things we remember, believe, and imagine is subjective. The social realities we share with different groups of people that are made out of things we agree about are intersubjective. These social realities influence our behavior and how we feel about life all the time, but we are rarely explicit about their nature. It took me till I was 54 to even learn the term intersubjectivity existed, and I’ve been a social philosophy nerd all my life. This talk is intended to expose the concept of intersubjectivity more fully in the hope that dragging it in to the light will give people who hear the talk a fresh and interesting perspective on how we build and update the social arrangements within which we live.	pmiller

This talk explores the intricate and often surprising ways that birds display their “affection”, revealing that their choices in mates are far from random. From the flamboyant plumage of peacocks to the elaborate dances of birds-of-paradise, we’ll delve into the evolutionary strategies that underpin these fabulous feathers and bizarre behaviors, and why more often than not, it pays to be choosy. Join us for a journey into the world of birds, where love is not just a feeling, but a complex interplay of signals and selection that challenges the notion that love is blind.	skhalil

Synthetic biology has enormous potential for building sustainability and clean energy technologies. However, we’re unable to take advantage of much of this potential because our knowledge of much of the most interesting things that nature has to offer remain limited. I’ll start this talk by reviewing a few breakthroughs that my lab has made over the past few years in biomining rare earth elements for sustainable energy technologies, microbial electroactivity and upgrading photosynthesis, and new mechanisms for genetic engineering. Then, I’ll discuss what my lab intends to do next, including building a Microbe-Mineral Atlas to discover new mechanisms that will allow highly efficient mining of metals; development of hyper-engineer able microbes; and how to use them to build high-performance autotrophic microbes.	bbarstow
25	December 5th	2024	Alec Pollak	PhD Candidate in the Department of Literatures in English at Cornell University	a publishing	On Strike Against God: Reflecting on 1970s Feminism Today	"""Let's be reasonable. Let's demand the impossible."" These words end On Strike Against God, a slim, long-lost lesbian novel set in Ithaca New York, by feminist science-fiction author Joanna Russ. Out of print for 40 years and now, finally, available again through the Feminist Press, On Strike Against God follows Esther, a Cornell English professor, as she has her first lesbian love affair and struggles to make sense of her life anew. On Strike Against God is an artifact of 1970s feminism, in good ways and bad: it's angry, controversial, and blunt. It's uninterested in nuance. It doesn't pull punches, and it doesn't apologize. It seeks to agitate, challenge, and offend. In so many ways, it's an easy target--ripe for critique. And yet, in a post-Roe v. Wade world, and on the precipice Trump 2.0, much of the novel rings urgently--and eerily--true today. What lessons can we learn from generations of feminists past, as history's clocks turn backwards? Alec Pollak recounts the process of rescuing, editing, and republishing On Strike Against God in 2024, and considers how, in light of November's election, we might engage feminist writings of yesteryear.

26	February 5th	2025	Jonny Robert Lawrence	Assistant Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell	a medieval studies	Down Bad in Medieval Baghdad, or a Tale as Old as Time	In the early 10th century, a man called Ibn Dāwūd died from love – or, that’s what the biographers tell us, at least. Ibn Dāwūd lived and died in Baghdad, at the time one of the world’s major centres of art, culture, science, and mathematics. He was a strict jurist and legal thinker, but also a flâneur, an aesthete and a poet-author. Upon meeting a beautiful local apothecary, Muḥammad ibn Jāmiʿ (or, was it Wahb ibn Jāmiʿ? The sources aren’t sure…), he falls madly in love and the pair embark upon a sweet, seemingly reciprocal relationship. Yet, love’s course is not as easy as it may seem and all sorts of personal, social and legal problems might get in the way… with fatal consequences. In this talk, we will be meeting our medieval forebears where they are at, and exploring how their tales of overwhelming passion, death and destruction can speak to us in the contemporary world.	jlawrence

This talk aims to expand the scopes of visual and material analysis by embracing Anishinaabe beliefs that recognize the ensouled animacy of animals and certain objects as non-human beings. Specifically, with the aid of Anishinaabe origin stories and principles such as mino-bimaadiziwin and biskaabiiyang, this talk shares how select artworks and objects act as political agents, entering into and influencing human and non-human compacts for the empowerment of Anishinaabe diplomacy.	nmapes
28	April 2nd	2025	Rediet Lewi	PhD Student in Anthopology at Cornell University	an anthropology	Anthropology and Fiction: Representing Distress on the Screen	Mental health has been an increasingly popular topic in our current public conversations. Even so, there continues to be contentious disagreements about how it is understood and expressed. Through a deeper look at belief systems that shape not only different cultures, but also biomedicine, I argue that knowledge about distress is not neutral. Instead, it is influenced by assumptions about nature of humanity in general but also by biased views about the nature of particular social groups. Anthropology and its ethnographic methods allow us to examine the complex layers of factors that color experiences of distress. In this talk, I ask, how do we best capture such experiences of distress? I explore the possibilities that are opened up by incorporating fiction into social science research and communication.	rlewi

Or why some have thousands of babies over their lifetime while others only have a few. These differences are shaped by evolution and the ways animals balance growing up, staying alive, and having babies—a concept known as life history theory. It explores how organisms invest energy into these activities and the combined strategies they use to maximize their chances of passing on genes. For those that win this evolutionary game, their legacy lives on through offspring ready to face the next round of natural selection. But for those that fall short, their lineage may persist, but with diminishing success. Mosquitoes are no exception to the rules of this game, and the choices they make will not only determine if they win or lose, but also if they spread disease along the way. Join me in exploring how mosquitoes play the game of life—and how their choices make them one of the deadliest animals on the planet.  	bjoh
