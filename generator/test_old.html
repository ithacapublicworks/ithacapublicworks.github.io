<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Brit Johnson</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Entomology at Cornell University.
<br>
<br>

Have you ever wondered why some animals live longer than others? Or why some have thousands of babies over their lifetime while others only have a few. These differences are shaped by evolution and the ways animals balance growing up, staying alive, and having babies—a concept known as life history theory. It explores how organisms invest energy into these activities and the combined strategies they use to maximize their chances of passing on genes. For those that win this evolutionary game, their legacy lives on through offspring ready to face the next round of natural selection. But for those that fall short, their lineage may persist, but with diminishing success. Mosquitoes are no exception to the rules of this game, and the choices they make will not only determine if they win or lose, but also if they spread disease along the way. Join me in exploring how mosquitoes play the game of life—and how their choices make them one of the deadliest animals on the planet.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Francine Barchett</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

The projected future of our planet reads like a dystopian novel: melting ice sheets, silent forests, smog-choked skies, and a world increasingly at war with itself. But the question is: can we solve issues this big in a world so deeply divided? I happen to research one of the most controversial conservation topics today: hunting in Africa. I also teach a Cornell undergraduate course that encourages students to communicate environmental issues across ideological lines while stepping outside echo chambers. In a cultural moment of “I’m right, you’re wrong,” this talk won’t offer easy answers—but it might leave you just a bit more curious, courageous, and ready to find common ground where you least expect it.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Rediet Lewi</span>
<br>PhD Student in Anthopology at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Mental health has been an increasingly popular topic in our current public conversations. Even so, there continues to be contentious disagreements about how it is understood and expressed. Through a deeper look at belief systems that shape not only different cultures, but also biomedicine, I argue that knowledge about distress is not neutral. Instead, it is influenced by assumptions about nature of humanity in general but also by biased views about the nature of particular social groups. Anthropology and its ethnographic methods allow us to examine the complex layers of factors that color experiences of distress. In this talk, I ask, how do we best capture such experiences of distress? I explore the possibilities that are opened up by incorporating fiction into social science research and communication.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Cátia P. Dombaxe</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

In the intricate world of nerve regeneration, some animals have a remarkable ability to heal what seems impossible — like goldfish, which can regenerate their spinal cords after injury. But what if we could unlock this same potential in humans? This talk dives into the fascinating science behind my research, where we use bioengineered materials to deliver nature-inspired regenerative proteins and enzymes, aiming to help damaged spinal cords recover. By blending biomaterials, neuroscience, and the wisdom of evolution, we’re exploring a future where spinal cord injuries no longer mean a lifetime of paralysis. Join me as we uncover how goldfish might hold the key to a medical breakthrough that could change lives.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Noah Mapes</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in the Department of History of Art and Visual Studies at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

It is important for the field of art history to celebrate the numerous histories of aesthetics and worldviews that converge, diverge, and create the United States. This talk aims to expand the scopes of visual and material analysis by embracing Anishinaabe beliefs that recognize the ensouled animacy of animals and certain objects as non-human beings. Specifically, with the aid of Anishinaabe origin stories and principles such as mino-bimaadiziwin and biskaabiiyang, this talk shares how select artworks and objects act as political agents, entering into and influencing human and non-human compacts for the empowerment of Anishinaabe diplomacy.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Jonny Robert Lawrence</span>
<br>Assistant Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell
<br>
<br>

In the early 10th century, a man called Ibn Dāwūd died from love – or, that’s what the biographers tell us, at least. Ibn Dāwūd lived and died in Baghdad, at the time one of the world’s major centres of art, culture, science, and mathematics. He was a strict jurist and legal thinker, but also a flâneur, an aesthete and a poet-author. Upon meeting a beautiful local apothecary, Muḥammad ibn Jāmiʿ (or, was it Wahb ibn Jāmiʿ? The sources aren’t sure…), he falls madly in love and the pair embark upon a sweet, seemingly reciprocal relationship. Yet, love’s course is not as easy as it may seem and all sorts of personal, social and legal problems might get in the way… with fatal consequences. In this talk, we will be meeting our medieval forebears where they are at, and exploring how their tales of overwhelming passion, death and destruction can speak to us in the contemporary world.

<br>A Local Sex Therapist (LMHC, MS)
<br>
<br>

Ever wondered why your body doesn’t always respond the way you expect in the bedroom? The answer lies in the science of the sexual response cycle. Join us for a brief dive into what we now know about sexual arousal, desire, and satisfaction—and how you can use this knowledge to improve your sex life tonight. You’ll learn about the revolutionary "dual control model" of sexual arousal, a game-changing framework that radically shifts the way we think about horniness. Whether you're looking to reignite the spark, enhance intimacy, or simply better understand your own body, this talk will offer practical insights you can start using right away!

<br>Assistant Professor in  Biological and Environmental Engineering, Atkinson Center for Sustainability Senior Faculty Fellow, and Carl Sagan Institute Fellow
<br>
<br>

Synthetic biology has enormous potential for building sustainability and clean energy technologies. However, we’re unable to take advantage of much of this potential because our knowledge of much of the most interesting things that nature has to offer remain limited. I’ll start this talk by reviewing a few breakthroughs that my lab has made over the past few years in biomining rare earth elements for sustainable energy technologies, microbial electroactivity and upgrading photosynthesis, and new mechanisms for genetic engineering. Then, I’ll discuss what my lab intends to do next, including building a Microbe-Mineral Atlas to discover new mechanisms that will allow highly efficient mining of metals; development of hyper-engineer able microbes; and how to use them to build high-performance autotrophic microbes.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Alec Pollak</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in the Department of Literatures in English at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

"Let's be reasonable. Let's demand the impossible." These words end On Strike Against God, a slim, long-lost lesbian novel set in Ithaca New York, by feminist science-fiction author Joanna Russ. Out of print for 40 years and now, finally, available again through the Feminist Press, On Strike Against God follows Esther, a Cornell English professor, as she has her first lesbian love affair and struggles to make sense of her life anew. On Strike Against God is an artifact of 1970s feminism, in good ways and bad: it's angry, controversial, and blunt. It's uninterested in nuance. It doesn't pull punches, and it doesn't apologize. It seeks to agitate, challenge, and offend. In so many ways, it's an easy target--ripe for critique. And yet, in a post-Roe v. Wade world, and on the precipice Trump 2.0, much of the novel rings urgently--and eerily--true today. What lessons can we learn from generations of feminists past, as history's clocks turn backwards? Alec Pollak recounts the process of rescuing, editing, and republishing On Strike Against God in 2024, and considers how, in light of November's election, we might engage feminist writings of yesteryear.

In the vibrant world of avian courtship, love takes on a dazzling array of forms. This talk explores the intricate and often surprising ways that birds display their “affection”, revealing that their choices in mates are far from random. From the flamboyant plumage of peacocks to the elaborate dances of birds-of-paradise, we’ll delve into the evolutionary strategies that underpin these fabulous feathers and bizarre behaviors, and why more often than not, it pays to be choosy. Join us for a journey into the world of birds, where love is not just a feeling, but a complex interplay of signals and selection that challenges the notion that love is blind.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Pete Miller</span>
<br>Local Expert
<br>
<br>

As human beings, we live in three kinds of reality. The single physical reality we all share full of rocks, trees, and beautiful gorges to walk through and appreciate them is objective. The internal mental reality we each have in our own mind made of things we remember, believe, and imagine is subjective. The social realities we share with different groups of people that are made out of things we agree about are intersubjective. These social realities influence our behavior and how we feel about life all the time, but we are rarely explicit about their nature. It took me till I was 54 to even learn the term intersubjectivity existed, and I’ve been a social philosophy nerd all my life. This talk is intended to expose the concept of intersubjectivity more fully in the hope that dragging it in to the light will give people who hear the talk a fresh and interesting perspective on how we build and update the social arrangements within which we live.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Elizabeth Medina-Gray</span>
<br>Associate Professor of Music Theory at Ithaca College
<br>
<br>

What makes a sound a “sound effect,” and what makes a sound “music”? While there are many examples of sounds in media that fit easily into one of these categories or the other, some sounds may seem to cross or blur the boundaries between these categories in interesting ways. In this presentation, I highlight some sounds in video games that are both sound effects and musical/music. I consider a variety of sounds from select games, for example very early games like Pong (1972), and more recent games like Super Mario Galaxy (2007). How might such musical sound effects (or sound-effect music) impact a player’s/listener’s experience with a game? Video games provide a rich field in which to explore blurry categories of “sound effect” and “music,” and these questions of function and musicality are also relevant more widely in our media-filled world.

As Kofi Annan, a previous Secretary General of the United Nations (UN) and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said, “More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.” All around the world, high school and college students are coming to understand the world’s most complex issues by becoming the delegates who debate them. Model United Nations (MUN) is a simulation of the UN, and it usually appeals to people interested in global politics, problem-solving with other like-minded delegates, public speaking, and debate. The TeenDay Ithaca MUN team will give an overview of the UN and what MUN is. We will explain how MUN allows students from all walks of life to explore new possible careers, and develop life skills such as public speaking, collaboration, and more. The end of the presentation will see a brief demo of what takes place in a MUN conference. Any and all points of inquiry will be addressed as long as decorum is maintained.

The origin story of Nollywood is intriguing, complex, and intertwined by multiple histories, people, and geographies – it unfolds like the most drama-packed film that you have yet to see. In terms of output, Nollywood is the second-largest film industry in the world. It is surpassed by Bollywood, with the United States-grown Hollywood taking the third slot. Nollywood has inspired the emergence of several African film industries, it orchestrates a space for post- colonial African migrants to engage with home-grown film productions, and lately, it has been expanding its reach via distribution on global streaming sites such as as Netflix. This talk asks: What is Nollywood, and how did it become a global film industry? How does the industry continue to position itself, both within and outside of Africa? Drawing on its origin story and its point of contact, I spotlight the exciting profile of this African film industry.

<br>Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

The construction industry is currently facing many challenges with respect to shortage of skilled workers, greenhouse gas emissions, and our need for massive quantities of construction materials. In this talk I will first focus on this global materials challenge and lay out pathways for achieving sustainability in the cement and concrete industry. These include examples such as the use of mineral waste materials, low- grade calcined clays, and carbonated steel slags. Next, I will focus on advances enabled through automation. Specifically, 3D printing with concrete or additive construction can be a path forward to efficiently use materials and reduce the amount of waste that is generated. Furthermore, robotic construction provides an opportunity to fabricate complex structures such as gyroids. A gyroid is a triply periodic minimal surface that efficiently distributes stress under compression loading in all orientations. Using a 2-component system with an in-house developed flowable mixture and with injection of accelerator at the nozzle, I will demonstrate our ability to print these complex geometries to create and test structural components such as walls.

<br>
<br>

Mangroves form an essential barrier between oceans and land protecting shorelines from storm surges and rising tides while mothers are threshold subjects that create a buffer between the public and private spheres preserving them as separate. But what can mangroves and mothers teach us about environmental resilience at a time when countries are firmly reasserting the nuclear family as the center of care and economic consumption ? This talk delves into Dulce (2018) a short ten-minute documentary co-directed by Guille Isa and Angello Faccini that grapples with the delicate ecosystem of a Pacific mangrove forest and a community of clam harvesters on the Pacific coast department of Nariño in Colombia. These mangrove mothers show us how porous boundaries and a politics of place create havens for social and physical life to thrive.

The language of apocalypse is seemingly all around us. From the devastation of war to the aftermath of voracious wildfires, from doomsday preppers to ecological collapse we confront the persistent vitality of apocalyptic language and thought.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Luke Keller</span>
<br>Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Ithaca College
<br>
<br>

 Are you planning a trip to the path of totality on April 8, 2024? You may be an umbraphile! Not sure what an umbraphile or a path of totality is? Join us as we explore the social and physical science of eclipses. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between Earth and the Sun casting its shadow on Earth’s surface. Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, but the shadow rarely passes over populated areas and most often passes over the oceans. The eclipse of April 2024 will be a rare treat because the moon will photo bomb the sun for tens of millions of people including communities right here in Central New York. We'll cover the details of how, when, and why eclipses happen and how to safely observe them.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Carlos Figueroa</span>
<br>Associate Professor of Politics at Ithaca College
<br>
<br>

 Bayard T. Rustin was a political activist, writer, and organizer committed to social, political, and economic justice and equality across different cultures, countries, and ideological perspectives.  His beliefs and actions often led to controversial positions.  Although Rustin is most well-known for organizing the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, he accomplished much more than that.  Sorry, Netflix!  This talk delves into how and why Rustin’s pragmatic Quaker faith influenced his politics and helped him navigate the various controversies of his time throughout an extraordinary life from the 1940s through the 1980s.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Elias Beltrán</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Salsa music and reggaetón, though most clearly articulated in the Hispanophone Caribbean, are related by diasporic connections coming from “histories of migrations and cultural exchange throughout all of the Americas.” And, though some scholars suggest that reggaetón should be read through its social and political “positioning to cultural expressions exclusively centered on blackness,” I respectfully disagree. While holding—and celebrating(!)—the African Diaspora as a creative nexus in both genres, exclusively positioning the cultural expressions of either salsa or reggaetón on blackness keeps us from connecting “asymmetrical histories and processes” that have, all too often, been examined separately, rather than approached as responses to shared conditions with deep implications. Looking at the musical presences and relations between African and Asian Diasporic subjects in salsa and reggateón refuses not only the idea of separate histories, but also exposes how racialized mimicry fuels antagonisms, and reinforces colonial subjects as negatively known and dispositively knowable. In this way, looking at the presence and contributions of the Chinese Diaspora in the musics of the Hispanophone Caribbean, previously a site of occlusion, emerges not as a pitting against but as a potential source of coalition-building precisely because of the intimacy of shared histories.

<br>Outreach and Information Services Librarian for the Cornell Prison Education Program
<br>
<br>

 New York State prisons are low-information environments, where there is no internet access and books and media are subject to strict censorship. How can librarians on the outside respond to incarcerated patrons' need for books and information? The Cornell Prison Education Program (CPEP) is grappling with these questions as they seek to create research opportunities and expand information access in prison in anticipation of their launch of a Cornell BA inside. In this talk, we'll discuss what it's like to build a library program for incarcerated students, introducing Cornell's world class research materials behind the walls. We'll learn about CPEP and its history, nationwide efforts to bring library resources to incarcerated patrons, and what we're doing at Cornell to provide incarcerated students with more academic resources. We'll also talk about how to get involved in CPEP! <br><br><div class="box"> <img src="images/Feb 7_ 2024_Maddie_Reynolds_1.jpg" class='center'> </div>

<br>
<br>

Do you find yourself freaking out over the state of the global environment, climate change, and loss of biodiversity? If so, you’re not alone — eco-anxiety has become one of the leading mental health issues in the third decade of the 21st century. Public gardens, which include botanic gardens, arboreta, conservatories, and historic landscapes, are addressing these seemingly overwhelming environmental challenges through their extensive collections, protection of natural areas, preservation of endangered species, and through programming and messaging. Will public gardens single-handedly solve all of these problems? No, but they can be a significant contributor to the solutions.

 Recent appraisals of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution often note with alarm that slavery remains a legal form of punishment and lament for how this loophole has been weaponized against black Americans.

<br>
<br>

 Ever wonder how others perceive you based on your actions? We all do. Shockingly, recent studies in psychology reveal we're often quite mistaken about these perceptions. For example, people think they're less liked by others than they actually are, or they assume others aren't interested in their unsolicited advice when in fact they are. Such findings could help us get along better with others. But how accurate are these studies? And is it possible that participants in these studies are just trying to appear 'nice' when answering research questions? In this talk, I'll share my own research on this topic and discuss if we should take these findings at face value.

Everyone is aware of the price of food – from kitchen tables to restaurant counters, food costs impact our lives in profound ways. But another, less understood cost associated with our food is born out of the pressures faced by farmers as they struggle to succeed working in one of the most unforgiving industries in America.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Heather Huson and Dr. Srikanth Krishnamoorthy</span>
<br>Cornell Dept. of Animal Science
<br>
<br>

Almost 100 years ago, Balto, along with a pack of elite sled dogs helped save the community of Nome, Alaska, from a diphtheria outbreak. Balto is representative of the sled dogs of the era who were reputed for their hardiness, endurance, and tolerance of harsh conditions at a time when northern communities relied on them for transportation, protection, and companionship. Unlike modern breeds, Balto and his contemporaries were products of generations of mating of diverse, outbred dogs selected for their performance and hardiness.  Today, Balto is immortalized with a statue in Central Park and is physically preserved and on display at the Cleaveland Museum of Natural History. We asked ourselves, could we use advances in genomic technologies and ancient DNA recovery techniques to parse through Balto’s DNA and understand selection emphasis and diversity occurring in sled dogs in the 1930’s? Could we decipher Balto’s physical appearance from his DNA and identify healthy developmental gene variants that may have endowed sled dogs in that era with abilities to withstand and thrive in harsh environments? Could we use our findings to guide modern breeders to breed healthier dogs? <br><br>Also, here's a photo of Dr. Huson racing as a musher in Alaska!<div class="box"> <img src="images/huson_sled.jpg" class='center'> </div>

<br>

Have you seen curling on TV, that weird game with stones, and brooms, and people yelling at each other on ice?  Maybe you caught the fever back in 2018, watching the Men’s curling team win USA’s first gold medal in the sport, saw it in a movie, or have visited Canada at any point in your life.  Alita started curling with the Finger Lakes Curling Club in 2018 after taking one of the first Learn to Curl’s, soon after the club’s founding.  She currently skips, is an instructor, volunteers on the club’s board, and travels to friendlies and bonspiels to compete and meet other curlers.  In a Public Works’ version of broomstacking, Alita will talk about the history, explain the types and rules of curling, and delve a little into the science, all while taking part in a major part of curling: drinking beverages.

Before the industrial revolution every healthy community on the planet included numerous storytellers, individuals trained in poetry, music and the dream-logic of mythology who would regularly dazzle their listeners with mind-opening tales of love, death and other worlds. Over the last century we have surrendered this power to multinational corporations, and the consequences have not been good. Performance storyteller Jay Leeming has spent years telling stories in theaters, schools, and National Parks, and in this talk he will not only illuminate his own process of learning to tell both the Odyssey and the Mahabharata epic of India but will also offer guidance in how we can turn off Netflix, awaken the visionary mythteller within each of us, and save the planet through story.

The gut microbiome, or the complex community of microbes that colonize the intestinal tract, can have a wide range of effects on their host’s physiology, metabolism, and behavior. In humans, much has been discovered about how these microbes impact a person’s health and wellbeing, but much less is known about how they influence the fitness of other animals. In this talk, Dr. Sprockett will explore the ways that the gut microbiome impacts their animals hosts ranging from rodents to birds and even primates, with a focus on how we know what we know. Topics will span from short-term responses to long-term evolutionary consequences, and even how microbes might be affecting everyday decisions. The presentation will conclude with a (hopeful!) look at the future of microbiome-based interventions.

“Step into the past!” Public communications related to archaeological sites often promise an immersive experience that allows visitors to enter a specific historic moment in a particular place, a kind of time travel. But how realistic is this premise? In this talk, I will begin with a case study of a Roman villa buried by the 79 CE eruption of Mount Vesuvius on the Bay of Naples, discussing its history of excavation, reconstruction, presentation to the public, and diffusion through contemporary media around the question of where, and whether, the “real” villa exists. The relevance of this question hinges on public perception: how do archaeologists communicate their findings and knowledge, as well as the gaps, with those who visit? I will close with a brief comparison to an American “archaeological” park and the ways that public-facing historical sites affect the way that people relate emotionally to the past.

<br>
<br>

Peter Higgs in 1963-64 proposed a mechanism and related particle that could explain how some other elementary particles acquired mass.  This theory led to a multi decade search for the eponymous Higgs boson and the construction of incredibly complex accelerators and detectors to generate and observe these proposed particles.  Finally in a data set from the period 2011-2013 the particle was observed experimentally, and this filled in the last bit of the standard model of particle physics.  Higgs and colleagues were awarded the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. <br><br> I’ll try to give some background on the accelerator and detectors at CERN that were used in this groundbreaking work.  Our current work is leading to a second-generation detector capable of detecting immense quantities of Higgs with great precision to fully understand its properties.

By taking advantage of recent technological advancements in unrelated disciplines and taking a statistical approach to mission assurance, Monarchs open the door to an entirely new paradigm in space access and exploration. This talk describes the challenges and advantages unique to tiny spacecraft. It also presents a number of use cases, involving distributed sensing and planetary science, that are unique to spacecraft of the Monarch’s diminutive size and large quantity. Results from simulated lunar impact survival tests and a case-study planetary science mission (conducted with cows) are presented and discussed, suggesting one particular use case, along with the results from launch tests conducted in collaboration with SpinLaunch.

<br>

For over a century, audio technology has been an integral component to experiencing and sharing music. Recording has evolved from a novelty which captured a vague facsimile of a performance to a technically superior mode of expression which in most cases supplants live performance. Throughout this evolution, there have been several instances where a technological advancement changed the recording and consumption processes permanently; mass duplication, electrical recording, magnetic tape, stereo capture and disc-cutting, multitrack recording, and digital recording are just a few of the most consequential advancements. In 2023, we are currently experiencing another transformative advancement – immersive audio. A once esoteric format has quickly become accessible to consumers through streaming platforms, and the recording industry is racing to catch up. This presentation will highlight a few of these key transformative events as well as some of the music indicative of these advancements. Emphasis will be placed on immersive audio technology, and musical examples will be played back over a (modest) immersive sound system. Perhaps history offers some clues to understand where we might be heading next.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Daniela Samur</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in the Cornell History Dept.
<br>
<br>

In late nineteenth century Bogotá, the Biblioteca Nacional –Colombia’s legal deposit library– was labeling some of its prints as “useless” and selling them as scrap. The money from the sales, directors of the Biblioteca explained, would be put to better use in paying for bindings. Other books, deemed more important and worth saving, needed to be properly bound so that they could resist peoples’ fingers, time, and mice. The tension between preservation and destruction at the Biblioteca Nacional in Bogotá during the late nineteenth century was not an issue about hierarchies of knowledge, but one about the daily and mundane logistics of ordering. This is a story about how workers at Colombia’s central library dreamed of an organized and exhaustive collection of prints but couldn’t even manage to walk through the hallways without stumbling over piles of books. Gathering, inventorying, cataloguing, and putting books on shelves, I show in this presentation, was a material practice, and one shaped by the scarcity of paper and of people’s penmanship.

<br>
<br>

Student: When did planets first form?<br><br>Prof. Luke: Well, within a few million years of the sun's formation the planets formed in a disk of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk.<br><br>Student: I know that. My question is when did the FIRST planets form? Was it right after the Big Bang?<br><br>Prof. Luke: Well...hmmm...I don't know, let's Google it.<br><br><br>Turns out no one knows in much detail. And so began my current research project. We understand the process of planet formation in our own galaxy with increasing detail and observational evidence, but how can we extend that understanding to planet formation in the early universe? Presumably the first planets formed around the first stars. In principle we can observe the first stars by observing the first galaxies, but they are so far away that the galaxies appear as dim red fuzzballs even using the James Webb Space Telescope. Resolving individual stars within those galaxies is not currently possible. We will explore this conundrum and a possible solution. Then we'll reward ourselves with some wild speculation about aliens.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Megan Barrington</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Since bygone eras of antiquity, humans have watched in astonishment, intrigue, and terror as brilliant orbs of light amidst an illuminated drift entered the heavenly spheres. Could they be harbingers of doom? Weather phenomena? Balls of fire in the sky? Wild speculations and superstitions ever follow in their wakes—but what are comets really? And what can we learn from them? After hundreds of years of asking such questions, we finally have some answers, even as so much remains unknown. Join us on a journey of fire and ice to discover how these objects once believed to signal the end of an era could be responsible for the origins of life as we understand it today.

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Seth Strickland</span>
<br>Joseph F. Martino \'53 Lecturer in the Dept. of Literatures in English at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

“The Last Medieval Scribe: John Colyns and Authorial Control,” takes the twilight of medieval manuscript culture as its focus. For a few years until 1521, a bookseller named John Colyns carefully constructed a book that was very ordinary for his time but one of a dying breed. It contained, among other things, both century-old medieval poem and one that was written during his lifetime, both copied by hand -- the latter likely from a copy circulated among friends of the author. Colyns prophesied the fame of the new works in the book to his book-binding efforts – we’ll discover whether his claim is founded or whether other forces upended his plans. With

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Ben Fried</span>
<br>Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Literatures in English at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

This talk will take you to the crossroads of power and creativity. Editors are the invisible gatekeepers of literature, shaping texts and tastes out of public sight. What do they actually do, and how have their actions changed literary history? “The Inside Story” will investigate three remarkable writer-editor relationships and three examples of editorial labor determining the fate of a literary work: one creative, one destructive, and one poised uneasily between the two. We will look at the Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul getting his start on BBC Radio; the short-story superstar Mavis Gallant falling out with The New Yorker; Penguin India risking it all on Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy, one of the longest novels ever written, and dominating the subcontinent as a result. And so we will move through the twentieth century—from the Caribbean to North America to South Asia—uncovering the editorial networks linking literary institutions in London and New York to Anglophone authors around the world. Drawing the editor from backstage to center stage, “The Inside Story” will illuminate the influence of this crucial cultural figure, for good and bad, from heyday to present-day decline.

Biological pigments or “biopigments” are what make life colorful but also resilient to radiation, lack of available liquid water, and harsh temperatures – the typical weather forecast in space! Microbes that live in ice have a pretty hard time with these conditions too, and so, they tend to be very colorful – which makes them very good references for what life may look like in the cosmos! Future telescopes will be able to search for these colorful features, but first we need to translate them from biology into the language of space missions: spectroscopy!<br><br>What does the spectral fingerprint of a biopigment look like? How can that help us search for life in the cosmos? And more importantly…can we really have planets covered by orange aliens?!

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Eve Snyder</span>
<br>Historian at The History Center in Tompkins County and Project Director of HistoryForge
<br>
<br>

Have you ever walked down a street and had something about an old building capture your eye? Perhaps an interesting architectural detail caused you to wonder when a house was built, who lived there, and what their lives were like? Ithaca\'s buildings and people of the past can serve as an important entry point into this community\'s history but what then? What does it take to encourage meaningful public engagement with history? Digital history projects have the potential to increase public engagement with the subject matter, but how can they avoid the trap of presenting a curated version of history that limits additional inquiry.<br><br>This talk is about <a href = "https://tompkins.historyforge.net/">HistoryForge</a>, an open-source digital history project from The History Center in Tompkins County that aims to engage the public in historical inquiry at all levels of the project\'s development: from helping to build the project\'s historical infrastructure by creating map layers and transcribing census records, to querying the resulting census data to learn more about the community and exploring the results on historic map layers.

Among Tolkien's many themes, pity, compassion, and mercy stand out as primary motivating elements for the narrative and the characters within it. Tolkien consistently treats these three as intrinsic virtues in a world full of suffering and loss. Explore the centrality of these themes to Tolkien, his world, and today.

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Seth Koproski</span>
<br>Lecturer in Cornell's Dept. of Literatures in English
<br>
<br>

Stories of phoenixes, werewolves, unicorns, and dragons fill our media, our libraries, and our minds-- yet, for some reason, we tend to think of medieval people as "silly" or "superstitious" for engaging with these same mythic animals. We understand that these creatures are not and were never "real", but they have served the needs of human writers and storytelling for millennia, including today. This talk is about taking these animals, and medieval belief in general, seriously, asking: Why do these beliefs exist and how were these beliefs practiced? In what books and in what places can we find fantastic animals? And what can the (non)existence of the dragon tell us about how medieval people constructed the world around them?
