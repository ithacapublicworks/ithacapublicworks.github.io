   <h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>Table for One Trivia</span></h3>
   Looking for something to do when it's not a Wednesday and there is no Public Works to learn from? Go to <a href = 'https://www.t41trivia.com/'>Table for One Trivia</a>! These trivia rounds are custom-made and are held Tuesdays at Collegetown Bagels right next to Cornell and on Thursdays at Ithaca Bakery. Funny answers get you points when you don't know the correct ones!


   <h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>The Downstairs</span></h3>
   Public Works is held at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, a local bar with a great beer selection and a regular series of events, from music to zine-making to comedy to open-mics. If you make them happy, you make us happy! Check out their <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/calendar-events'>upcoming events</a>.

   <h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>The Watershed</span></h3>
   Just upstairs is <a href = 'https://ithacawatershed.com/'>The Watershed</a>, another bar run by the same team as The Downstairs. Unlike other bars in the area, a quiet, conversational audio level is maintained. Bring your friends, have a few drinks, and actually <i>talk</i> to them!
