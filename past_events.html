<h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Who Lived Here? Using HistoryForge to Engage People in Local History in Ithaca, NY and Beyond"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Eve Snyder</span>
<br>Historian at The History Center in Tompkins County and Project Director of HistoryForge
<br>
<br>

Have you ever walked down a street and had something about an old building capture your eye? Perhaps an interesting architectural detail caused you to wonder when a house was built, who lived there, and what their lives were like? Ithaca's buildings and people of the past can serve as an important entry point into this community's history but what then? What does it take to encourage meaningful public engagement with history? Digital history projects have the potential to increase public engagement with the subject matter, but how can they avoid the trap of presenting a curated version of history that limits additional inquiry.<br><br>This talk is about HistoryForge, an open-source digital history project from The History Center in Tompkins County that aims to engage the public in historical inquiry at all levels of the project's development: from helping to build the project's historical infrastructure by creating map layers and transcribing census records, to querying the resulting census data to learn more about the community and exploring the results on historic map layers.

<h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Pity, Compassion, and Mercy in Tolkien's Writings"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by James Nagy</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Among Tolkien's many themes, pity, compassion, and mercy stand out as primary motivating elements for the narrative and the characters within it. Tolkien consistently treats these three as intrinsic virtues in a world full of suffering and loss. Explore the centrality of these themes to Tolkien, his world, and today.

A <i>humanities</i> talk:


<h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Did We Believe in Dragons?: Fantastic Animals and the Medieval North Atlantic"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Seth Koproski</span>
<br>a Lecturer in Cornell's Dept. of Literatures in English
<br>
<br>

Stories of phoenixes, werewolves, unicorns, and dragons fill our media, our libraries, and our minds-- yet, for some reason, we tend to think of medieval people as "silly" or "superstitious" for engaging with these same mythic animals. We understand that these creatures are not and were never "real", but they have served the needs of human writers and storytelling for millennia, including today. This talk is about taking these animals, and medieval belief in general, seriously, asking: Why do these beliefs exist and how were these beliefs practiced? In what books and in what places can we find fantastic animals? And what can the (non)existence of the dragon tell us about how medieval people constructed the world around them?

<h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"A Song of Ice and Dust, or: Why We're Sending a 40 Million Dollar Flying Trash Can to Europa"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Zach Ulibarri</span>
<br>a Postdoc in Cornell's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Dept.
<br>
<br>

If you wanted to search for aliens in our very own solar system, where would you look?<br>    What types of signals or measurements could convince you that life is actually there?    <br>    Why is the University of Colorado building a $40 million flying trash can and sending it to Europa?    <br>    How can a flying trash can find signs of habitability or even potentially alien life?    <br>    What in the world does any of that have to do with dust?    <br>Find out at the inaugural Public Works!
