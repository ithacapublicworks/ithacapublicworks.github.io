The October 5th Public Works event featured two talk flavors in one night:
<br>
<br>


    A <i>humanities</i> talk:
    <br>



    <h3>"Did We Believe in Dragons?: Fantastic Animals and the Medieval North Atlantic"</h3>

    by Dr. Seth Koproski, a lecturer at Cornell:
    <br>
    <br>


    Stories of phoenixes, werewolves, unicorns, and dragons fill our media, our libraries, and our minds-- yet, for some reason, we tend to think of medieval people as 'silly' or 'superstitious' for engaging with these same mythic animals. We understand that these creatures are not and were never 'real', but they have served the needs of human writers and storytelling for millennia, including today. This talk is about taking these animals, and medieval belief in general, seriously, asking: Why do these beliefs exist and how were these beliefs practiced? In what books and in what places can we find fantastic animals? And what can the (non)existence of the dragon tell us about how medieval people constructed the world around them?

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    And a <i>science</i> talk:


    <h3>"A Song of Ice and Dust, or: Why We're Sending a 40 Million Dollar Flying Trash Can to Europa" (See the <a href='A Song of Ice and Dust.png'>pretty poster!</a>)</h3>

    by Dr. Zach Ulibarri, a postdoc at Cornell:

    <br>
    <br>
    If you wanted to search for aliens in our very own solar system, where would you look?
    <br>

    What types of signals or measurements could convince you that life is actually there?
    <br>

    Why is the University of Colorado building a $40 million flying trash can and sending it to Europa?
    <br>

    How can a flying trash can find signs of habitability or even potentially alien life?
    <br>

    What in the world does any of that have to do with dust?
    <br>
