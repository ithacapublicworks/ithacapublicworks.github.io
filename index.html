If you’re thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It’s a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We’re bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!
<br>
<br>


Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>November 2nd</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature two talks:


<br>
<br>


    A <i>history</i> talk:
    <br>
    <br>


    <h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Who Lived Here? Using HistoryForge to Engage People in Local History in Ithaca, NY and Beyond"</span></h3>

    by Dr. Eve Snyder, Historian at The History Center in Tompkins County and Project Director of HistoryForge.
    <br>
    <br>

    Have you ever walked down a street and had something about an old building capture your eye? Perhaps an interesting architectural detail caused you to wonder when a house was built, who lived there, and what their lives were like? Ithaca’s buildings and people of the past can serve as an important entry point into this community’s history but what then? What does it take to encourage meaningful public engagement with history? Digital history projects have the potential to increase public engagement with the subject matter, but how can they avoid the trap of presenting a curated version of history that limits additional inquiry.
    <br>
    <br>

    This talk is about HistoryForge, an open-source digital history project from The History Center in Tompkins County that aims to engage the public in historical inquiry at all levels of the project’s development: from helping to build the project’s historical infrastructure by creating map layers and transcribing census records, to querying the resulting census data to learn more about the community and exploring the results on historic map layers.


    <br>
    <br>

    And a <i>humanities</i> talk:


    <h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Pity, Compassion, and Mercy in Tolkien’s Writings"</span></h3>

    by James Nagy.

    <br>
    <br>
  Among Tolkien’s many themes, pity, compassion, and mercy stand out as primary motivating elements for the narrative and the characters within it. Tolkien consistently treats these three as intrinsic virtues in a world full of suffering and loss. Explore the centrality of these themes to Tolkien, his world, and today.
