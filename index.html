If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!
<br>

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

Do you find yourself freaking out over the state of the global environment, climate change, and loss of biodiversity? If so, you’re not alone- eco-anxiety has become one of the leading mental health issues in the third decade of the 21st century. Public gardens, which include botanic gardens, arboreta, conservatories, and historic landscapes, are addressing these seemingly overwhelming environmental challenges through their extensive collections, protection of natural areas, preservation of endangered species, and through programming and messaging. Will public gardens single-handedly solve all of these problems? No, but they can be a significant contributor to the solutions. In this talk you’ll learn some of the ways they are making a difference.



<br><br>and <i>a Classics and philosophy</i> talk:


<h3 id='tonialimi'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Title Coming Soon!"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Dr. Toni Alimi</span>
<br>Klarman Postdoctoral Fellow in Classics and Philosophy at Cornell University
