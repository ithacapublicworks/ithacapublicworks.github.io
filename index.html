If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>June 5th</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>an environmental engineering</i> talk:


<h3 id='snair'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Sustainability and Automation: The Future of Concrete Industry"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Sriramya Nair</span>
<br>Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

The construction industry is currently facing many challenges with respect to shortage of skilled workers,
greenhouse gas emissions, and our need for massive quantities of construction materials. In this talk I will
first focus on this global materials challenge and lay out pathways for achieving sustainability in the
cement and concrete industry. These include examples such as the use of mineral waste materials, low-
grade calcined clays, and carbonated steel slags. Next, I will focus on advances enabled through
automation. Specifically, 3D printing with concrete or additive construction can be a path forward to
efficiently use materials and reduce the amount of waste that is generated. Furthermore, robotic
construction provides an opportunity to fabricate complex structures such as gyroids. A gyroid is a triply
periodic minimal surface that efficiently distributes stress under compression loading in all orientations.
Using a 2-component system with an in-house developed flowable mixture and with injection of
accelerator at the nozzle, I will demonstrate our ability to print these complex geometries to create and
test structural components such as walls.



<br><br>and <i>an environmental humanities</i> talk:


<h3 id='slopez'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Mangrove Mothers: Environmental Resilience at the Edges of the Colombian Nation"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Stephanie M. López</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Romance Studies and Mellon Graduate Fellow at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

Mangroves form an essential barrier between oceans and land protecting shorelines from storm surges and rising tides while mothers are threshold subjects that create a buffer between the public and private spheres preserving them as separate. But what can mangroves and mothers teach us about environmental resilience at a time when countries are firmly reasserting the nuclear family as the center of care and economic consumption ? This talk delves into Dulce (2018) a short ten-minute documentary co-directed by Guille Isa and Angello Faccini that grapples with the delicate ecosystem of a Pacific mangrove forest and a community of clam harvesters on the Pacific coast department of Nariño in Colombia. These mangrove mothers show us how porous boundaries and a politics of place create havens for social and physical life to thrive.
