If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Lisa Swayze</span>
<br>Executive Director, Buffalo Street Books/Ithaca Literary.
<br>
<br>

What is an independent bookstore and what does it contribute to a community that no other business or online retailer can? Learn more through the example of Ithaca's beloved Buffalo Street Books.</br>Lisa Swayze is the executive director of Ithaca Literary Ltd (ILL), which is the home of Ithaca's nonprofit independent bookstore, Buffalo Street Books. She also serves on the board of the American Booksellers Association.  



<br><br>and a <i>science</i> talk:


<h3 id='bjoh'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Role for Success: Adventures in Mosquito Evolution"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Brit Johnson</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Entomology at Cornell University.
<br>
<br>

Have you ever wondered why some animals live longer than others? Or why some have thousands of babies over their lifetime while others only have a few. These differences are shaped by evolution and the ways animals balance growing up, staying alive, and having babies—a concept known as life history theory. It explores how organisms invest energy into these activities and the combined strategies they use to maximize their chances of passing on genes. For those that win this evolutionary game, their legacy lives on through offspring ready to face the next round of natural selection. But for those that fall short, their lineage may persist, but with diminishing success. Mosquitoes are no exception to the rules of this game, and the choices they make will not only determine if they win or lose, but also if they spread disease along the way. Join me in exploring how mosquitoes play the game of life—and how their choices make them one of the deadliest animals on the planet.
