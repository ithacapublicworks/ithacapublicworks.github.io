If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>March 5th</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br><i>a health sciences</i> talk:


<h3 id='cdombaxe'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Nature’s Secret to Spinal Cord Healing: What Goldfish Can Teach Us About Recovery"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Cátia P. Dombaxe</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

In the intricate world of nerve regeneration, some animals have a remarkable ability to heal what seems impossible — like goldfish, which can regenerate their spinal cords after injury. But what if we could unlock this same potential in humans? This talk dives into the fascinating science behind my research, where we use bioengineered materials to deliver nature-inspired
regenerative proteins and enzymes, aiming to help damaged spinal cords recover. By blending
biomaterials, neuroscience, and the wisdom of evolution, we’re exploring a future where spinal
cord injuries no longer mean a lifetime of paralysis. Join me as we uncover how goldfish might
hold the key to a medical breakthrough that could change lives.



<br><br>and <i>an art history</i> talk:


<h3 id='nmapes'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Materializing Alliances: How Artworks Can Act as Diplomats in Anishinaabe Politics"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Noah Mapes</span>
<br>PhD Candidate in the Department of History of Art and Visual Studies at Cornell University
<br>
<br>

It is important for the field of art history to celebrate the numerous histories of aesthetics and worldviews that converge, diverge, and create the United States. This talk aims to expand the scopes of visual and material analysis by embracing Anishinaabe beliefs that recognize the ensouled animacy of animals and certain objects as non-human beings. Specifically, with the aid of Anishinaabe origin stories and principles such as mino-bimaadiziwin and biskaabiiyang, this talk shares how select artworks and objects act as political agents, entering into and influencing human and non-human compacts for the empowerment of Anishinaabe diplomacy.
