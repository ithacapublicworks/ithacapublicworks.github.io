If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>June 7th</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br>

A <i>humanities</i> talk:


<h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Replica, Repair, Forgery: Archaeological Sites as Art Forms"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Allison Ritterhaus</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 “Step into the past!” Public communications related to archaeological sites often promise an immersive experience that allows visitors to enter a specific historic moment in a particular place, a kind of time travel. But how realistic is this premise? In this talk, I will begin with a case study of a Roman villa buried by the 79 CE eruption of Mount Vesuvius on the Bay of Naples, discussing its history of excavation, reconstruction, presentation to the public, and diffusion through contemporary media around the question of where, and whether, the “real” villa exists. The relevance of this question hinges on public perception: how do archaeologists communicate their findings and knowledge, as well as the gaps, with those who visit? I will close with a brief comparison to an American “archaeological” park and the ways that public-facing historical sites affect the way that people relate emotionally to the past.





<br><br>and a <i>chemistry</i> talk:


<h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Behind the Taste: The Chemistry of Whiskey"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Dr. Daisy Rosas Vargas</span>
<br>Associate Professor of Chemistry at Ithaca College
<br>
