If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!
<br>

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>May 3rd</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

A <i>film</i> talk:


<h3><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Movie Magic/Sounding Dissent"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Molly Ryan</span>
<br>Director of Cornell Cinema
<br>
<br>

In this two-part presentation, Molly Ryan, the new director of Cornell Cinema, will outline her programming vision for Cornell Cinema and argue why it still matters to see films in movie theater. She will then discuss her research on sound and violence in the work of British television director Alan Clarke (and why it might not make sense to show these films at Cornell Cinema despite how much she loves them). Her presentation will explore Clarke’s engagement with sound, domestic space, and the media landscape of Thatcherite Britain in three films produced for the BBC (ROAD, CHRISTINE, and STARS OF THE ROLLER STATE DISCO), focusing on how Clarke effectively weaponized the genre of the television play in the 1980s, using it to nationalize his political dissent, undermine Margaret Thatcher’s political rhetoric, and problematize British nationalism.

<br><br>and a <i>science</i> talk:


<h3><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"What the Hell is a Higgs's Boson? An Insider's Look at the Physics of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Karl Smolenski</span>

Peter Higgs in 1963-64 proposed a mechanism and related particle that could explain how some other elementary particles acquired mass.  This theory led to a multi decade search for the eponymous Higgs boson and the construction of incredibly complex accelerators and detectors to generate and observe these proposed particles.  Finally in a data set from the period 2011-2013 the particle was observed experimentally, and this filled in the last bit of the standard model of particle physics.  Higgs and colleagues were awarded the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. <br><br> I’ll try to give some background on the accelerator and detectors at CERN that were used in this groundbreaking work.  Our current work is leading to a second-generation detector capable of detecting immense quantities of Higgs with great precision to fully understand its properties.  As an engineer I’ll give some practical examples of the problems that need to be solved to enable this science.
