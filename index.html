If you're thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It's a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We're bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!

Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The <span style='color: #00FFFF'>October 1st</span> <span style='color: #FF00FF'>Public Works</span> event will feature 2 talks:

<br><br>a <i>music and technology</i> talk:


<h3 id='dtur'><span style='color: #FF00FF'>"Local Music is Important"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #00FFFF'> by Doug Turnbull</span>
<br>Professor of Computer Science at Cornell
<br>
<br>

There are talented musicians all around us. They play amazing live shows at small venues in every city all around the world. Yet music services like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and TikTok do a poor job of helping listeners discover these artists for a variety of commercial, social, and technical reasons.  In this talk, we argue that supporting local music scenes is important and that we can use music recommender systems, such as <a href="https://localify.org">Localify.org</a>, to help promote local artists and live music events.



<br><br>and an <i>art and environment</i> talk:


<h3 id='jend'><span style='color: #00FFFF'>"Learning from LAND: Art, Ecology, and Environmental Activism"</span></h3>

<span style='color: #FF00FF'> by Jen de los Reyes & Oscar Rene Cornejo</span>
<br>Associate Professor of Art at Cornell, Assistant Professor of Art at Cornell
<br>
<br>

Jen de los Reyes and Oscar Rene Cornejo will discuss their collaborative project <a href="https://www.jendelosreyes.com/land">LAND</a>, which combines histories of artists' engagement with land-based practices and techniques with environmental regeneration and conservation to cultivate sustainable futures.
